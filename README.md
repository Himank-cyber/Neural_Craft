# Financial Complaint Classification Model

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that was made for Neural Craft 2026 by ArIES IITR. 

The primary goal of this project is to:
* Clean the text from complaints
* Finetune a pretrained machine learning framework designed for natural language processing like BERT on the given training set
* Predict the Primary and Secondary class along with the severity estimation of the complaint
* Create a CSV file with the predicted targets for submission

## 📂 Data Source
The dataset used in this notebook was obtained from Kaggle challenge of Neural Craft itself.
